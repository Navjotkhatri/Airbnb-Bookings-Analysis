# Airbnb Data Analysis

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

## Project Overview

This dataset contains around 49,000 observations with 16 columns, encompassing a mix of categorical and numeric values. The analysis aims to explore and derive key understandings, including insights into different hosts and areas, predictions on locations, prices, and reviews, identification of busiest hosts, evaluation of traffic among different areas, and possible reasons for variations.
